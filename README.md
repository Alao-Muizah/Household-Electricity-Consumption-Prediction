# Household-Electricity-Consumption-Prediction

Household Electric Power Consumption Prediction Web App
Overview

This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts household Global Active Power based on user inputs and derived features using a LightGBM machine learning model. It allows users to input real-world electricity readings in an easy-to-understand format and get instant predictions.

Technologies Used

Python: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, lightgbm, joblib, matplotlib

Web app: Streamlit

Usage

Clone the repo: git clone <https://github.com/Alao-Muizah/Household-Electricity-Consumption-Prediction/tree/Electricity-Branch>

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app: ElectricityConsumptionPrediction_WebApp.py

Enter your electricity readings and view the predicted Global Active Power.

Dataset:

Based on Individual Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset

Includes features like Global_reactive_power, Voltage, Global_intensity, and sub-metering
